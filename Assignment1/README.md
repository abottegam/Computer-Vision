<h1>Image Loading and Adjustments Assignment</h1>

<p>This assignment involves implementing an image processing application to understand fundamental operations like image loading, histogram generation, and applying brightness/contrast adjustments. The implementation will also include previewing and saving modified images.</p>

<h2>Assignment Objectives</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Gain hands-on experience with image processing using tools like OpenCV.</li>
    <li>Learn how to dynamically adjust image properties (brightness and contrast) using scroll bars.</li>
    <li>Implement the following functionalities:</li>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Load Image:</strong> Display the given image on the screen.</li>
        <li><strong>Draw Histogram:</strong> Generate and display the histogram of the image.</li>
        <li><strong>Preview:</strong> Load a preview version of the image with adjustable properties.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjustments:</strong> Add scroll bars for brightness and contrast adjustments.</li>
        <li><strong>Save:</strong> Implement a save feature via a button or keyboard shortcut.</li>
        <li><strong>Reload Settings:</strong> Ensure adjustments persist when the application reloads.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Programming Language:</strong> Use Python with OpenCV or similar libraries.</li>
    <li><strong>Development Environment:</strong> Ensure your setup supports graphical rendering for image display.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p><strong>Run the Program:</strong> Execute your code to perform the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Load and display the original image.</li>
    <li>Draw and display the histogram of the image.</li>
    <li>Adjust brightness and contrast dynamically using the scroll bars.</li>
    <li>Preview and save the modified image.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Expected Output</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Image 1:</strong> The original image with its histogram.</li>
    <li><strong>Image 2:</strong> The preview image with adjustments and its histogram.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Demonstration</h2>

<p>Watch the file demo for a video demonstration of the program.</p>
